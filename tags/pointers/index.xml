A high-level language built for technical computing. In Matlab, indexing start at 1, which I at the time never thought twice about.
I have been teaching Python to engineers with non-software background internally at work for some time, and I often get the question
Why does indexing start at $0$ instead of $1$?
People quickly get used to indexing starting at $0$ though.</description></item></channel></rss>
