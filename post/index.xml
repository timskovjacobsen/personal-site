Maybe you have data in point cloud form from an object scan and want to detect the outer perimeter.
In this post, we will take a look at an efficient way of computing the so-called convex hull of a set of points in 2D.
Convex Hull
A convex hull is a convex polygon that encloses all the points in a point set.</description></item><item><title>Why indexing starts at 0</title><link>http://localhost:1313/post/zero_indexing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 May 2021 10:56:59 +0200</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/post/zero_indexing/</guid><description>My first programming experience was in Matlab. A high-level language built for technical computing. In Matlab, indexing start at 1, which I at the time never thought twice about.
I have been teaching Python to engineers with non-software background internally at work for some time, and I often get the question
Why does indexing start at $0$ instead of $1$?
People quickly get used to indexing starting at $0$ though.</description></item></channel></rss>
